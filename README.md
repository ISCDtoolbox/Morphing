This repository contains the code morphing for deforming a template mesh onto a target shape associated to the journal article 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631073X16300802. 

### Installation
 
You can grab the sources by cloning this repository or downloading a .zip archive of the sources. In order to build the project, navigate to the created directory and in a command prompt type:

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make

(sudo) make install


### Usage

In a terminal, run:

usage: morphing [-h] [-nit n] [-dref nref [refs]] [-bref nref [refs]] [-elref nref [refs]] target_file[.mesh] template_file[.mesh]  

Together with the target_file[.mesh] a scalar field target_file.sol should be provided. 

Please run:
morphing [-h] 
to see the default parameters.
